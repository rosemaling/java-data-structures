# java-data-structures

## description
java-data-structures is what it sounds like: some simple data structures (including linked lists, queues, and stacks) built in java using tdd practices. a core benefit of having implemented these data structures, as simple as they are, is having refined my grasp on java and testing, as well as continuing to prepare for real-world problem-solving tasks at vmware. relevantly, i built out java-data-structures independently (i.e., without a pair) during my time in the vmware ascent technical program.
